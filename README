* WARNING : This is *NOT* a stable release, it's even more unstable than the trunk, because all scripts and patchs are designed for trunk, and have been quickly 
ported to v4, it's only for *TESTING*, so if you encounter some problems, please report all of these, and test if they are present in trunk or not *
* Because authserver have been removed directly in HopMod-v4, if you want to install one, please choose the trunk version *
